# Live Classes - Student Guide

## 🎯 How Live Classes Work

Live Classes are scheduled video sessions that run **3 times per day** - morning, afternoon, and evening. The best part? **You use the same link every time** - it automatically shows the current session based on what time you access it!

---

## 🔗 One Link, Always Current

### The Magic Link

Once you have a live class link, **you keep using the same link forever**. The link automatically shows:
- **Morning session** if you access it between 6:00 AM - 12:59 PM
- **Afternoon session** if you access it between 1:00 PM - 6:59 PM  
- **Evening session** if you access it between 7:00 PM - 5:59 AM

**Example Link:**
```
https://yoursite.com/live-classes/{live-class-id}/session/{session-id}
```

**This same link works:**
- ✅ Today at 7 AM → Shows morning session
- ✅ Today at 2 PM → Shows afternoon session
- ✅ Today at 8 PM → Shows evening session
- ✅ Tomorrow → Automatically shows tomorrow's video
- ✅ Next week → Automatically shows next week's video

## 📅 Daily Schedule

### 3 Sessions Per Day

Each live class runs **3 times per day** with the **same video**:

| Time | Session Type | Video |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **6:30 AM** | 🌅 Morning | Same video for the day |
| **1:00 PM** | ☀️ Afternoon | Same video for the day |
| **7:30 PM** | 🌙 Evening | Same video for the day |

### Same Video, All Day

- **Day 1**: Video 1 plays in all 3 sessions (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Day 2**: Video 2 plays in all 3 sessions (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Day 3**: Video 3 plays in all 3 sessions (morning, afternoon, evening)
- And so on...

**Example:**

- **Monday 8 PM** → Video 1 (Evening session) - *same video*
