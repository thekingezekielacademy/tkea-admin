# 📚 Batch Class System - Complete Documentation

## 🎯 System Overview

The TKEA Batch Class System operates as a **school-like learning platform** where 5 different classes run on different days of the week, each progressing day-by-day through their curriculum. **Each class starts on its designated weekday**, and **new batches start every week** on that same day, allowing multiple batches of the same class to run concurrently.

---

## 📖 The 5 Classes & Their Start Days

Each class has its **own designated start day** and progresses sequentially:

1. **FREELANCING - THE UNTAPPED MARKET** → Starts **MONDAY**
2. **INFORMATION MARKETING: THE INFINITE CASH LOOP** → Starts **TUESDAY**
3. **YOUTUBE MONETIZATION: From Setup To Monetization** → Starts **WEDNESDAY**
4. **EARN 500K SIDE INCOME SELLING EBOOKS** → Starts **THURSDAY**
5. **CPA MARKETING BLUEPRINT: TKEA RESELLERS - TOTALLY FREE** → Starts **FRIDAY**

---

## 🗓️ How The System Works

### Class Progression Pattern

**Each class progresses day-by-day from its start day:**

- **FREELANCING (Monday start):**
  - Monday = Class 1
  - Tuesday = Class 2
  - Wednesday = Class 3
  - Thursday = Class 4
  - Friday = Class 5
  - Monday (next week) = Class 6
  - Continues until curriculum ends

- **INFORMATION MARKETING (Tuesday start):**
  - Tuesday = Class 1
  - Wednesday = Class 2
  - Thursday = Class 3
  - Friday = Class 4
  - Monday = Class 5
  - Tuesday (next week) = Class 6
  - Continues until curriculum ends

- **YOUTUBE (Wednesday start):**
  - Wednesday = Class 1
  - Thursday = Class 2
  - Friday = Class 3
  - Monday = Class 4
  - Tuesday = Class 5
  - Wednesday (next week) = Class 6
  - Continues until curriculum ends

- **EBOOKS (Thursday start):**
  - Thursday = Class 1
  - Friday = Class 2
  - Monday = Class 3
  - Tuesday = Class 4
  - Wednesday = Class 5
  - Thursday (next week) = Class 6
  - Continues until curriculum ends

- **CPA MARKETING (Friday start):**
  - Friday = Class 1
  - Monday = Class 2
  - Tuesday = Class 3
  - Wednesday = Class 4
  - Thursday = Class 5
  - Friday (next week) = Class 6
  - Continues until curriculum ends

### Weekly Batch Creation

**New batches start every week on each class's designated day:**

- **Every Monday:** New FREELANCING batch starts (Class 1)
- **Every Tuesday:** New INFORMATION MARKETING batch starts (Class 1)
- **Every Wednesday:** New YOUTUBE batch starts (Class 1)
- **Every Thursday:** New EBOOKS batch starts (Class 1)
- **Every Friday:** New CPA MARKETING batch starts (Class 1)

### Multiple Concurrent Batches

**Multiple batches of the same class run simultaneously:**

- Batch 1 might be on Class 6
- Batch 2 might be on Class 5
- Batch 3 might be on Class 4
- Batch 4 might be on Class 3
- Batch 5 might be on Class 2
- Batch 6 (NEW) starts with Class 1

**All batches progress day-by-day independently.**

## 🎬 Session Structure

### 3 Sessions Per Day

**Each class session runs 3 times per day** with the **same video**:

- **🌅 Morning:** 6:30 AM
- **☀️ Afternoon:** 1:00 PM
- **🌙 Evening:** 7:30 PM

**Example for FREELANCING Batch 1, Class 1 (Monday):**
- Monday 6:30 AM → Class 1 (Morning session)
- Monday 1:00 PM → Class 1 (Afternoon session) - *same video*
- Monday 7:30 PM → Class 1 (Evening session) - *same video*

**Tuesday:**
- Tuesday 6:30 AM → Class 2 (Morning session) - *new video*
- Tuesday 1:00 PM → Class 2 (Afternoon session) - *same video*
- Tuesday 7:30 PM → Class 2 (Evening session) - *same video*

---

## 🎓 Batch Format

Each class session follows this naming convention:

```
[CLASS NAME]: CLASS [NUMBER] "[SESSION TITLE/VIDEO NAME]" - [DAY] [DATE], BATCH [NUMBER]
```

### Examples:

```
FREELANCING - THE UNTAPPED MARKET: CLASS 1 "Introduction to Freelancing" - MON JAN 19TH, BATCH 1
INFORMATION MARKETING: THE INFINITE CASH LOOP: CLASS 1 "The Cash Loop Explained" - TUE JAN 20TH, BATCH 1
YOUTUBE MONETIZATION: From Setup To Monetization: CLASS 1 "YouTube Setup Basics" - WED JAN 21ST, BATCH 1
```

---

## 🔐 Access Control & Replay Restrictions

### Full Access Users
- ✅ Can **replay** any class session
- ✅ Can access all previous sessions in their batch
- ✅ Full access to the entire curriculum

### Limited Access Users
- ❌ **Cannot replay** classes
- ⚠️ When clicking **REPLAY** button, they see a popup:
  - **Message**: "Only users who have full access can replay"
  - **Content**: Bank transfer details
  - **Button**: Similar to the "joinbuildnow" button (payment/upgrade CTA)

### Implementation Notes
- Replay functionality should check user's access level
- Popup should match the design/functionality of existing "joinbuildnow" component
- Bank transfer details should be dynamically pulled from system settings

   - **FREELANCING:** Cron job runs every Monday at 00:00 UTC
   - **INFORMATION MARKETING:** Cron job runs every Tuesday at 00:00 UTC
   - **YOUTUBE:** Cron job runs every Wednesday at 00:00 UTC
   - **EBOOKS:** Cron job runs every Thursday at 00:00 UTC
   - **CPA MARKETING:** Cron job runs every Friday at 00:00 UTC
   
   **Action:**
   - Get last batch number for that class
   - Create new batch with incremented batch number
   - Set start_date to current day (Monday/Tuesday/etc.)
   - Auto-enroll any pending users

2. **Daily Session Generation**
   - Runs daily at 00:00 UTC
   - For each active batch:
     - Calculate current session number based on days since batch start
     - Account for class's start day of week
     - Create 3 sessions (morning, afternoon, evening) for that day
     - Assign video based on session_number (sequential, not cyclical)

3. **Notification Scheduling**
   - Trigger: When a new session is created
   - Action:
     - Calculate 5 notification times (5 days, 48h, 24h, 3h, 30m before)
     - Create notification records for all enrolled users in that batch
     - Queue notifications for background processing

4. **Notification Sending**
   - Trigger: Background job runs every minute
   - Action:
     - Check for notifications where `scheduled_send_time <= now()` AND `status = 'pending'`
     - Send notification (email, Telegram, etc.)
     - Update `sent_at` and `status = 'sent'`

5. **Access Control Check**
   - Middleware/function checks user's access level
   - Validates if user can replay based on enrollment and access_level
   - Returns appropriate response (content or popup trigger)

### API Endpoints Needed

1. **GET /api/batches/current** - Get current active batches for all classes

3. ✅ Access granted - Video/content loads

### Replay Scenario - Limited Access User
1. User clicks "REPLAY" on FREELANCING Class 1 (from 3 days ago)
2. System checks: `user.access_level !== 'full_access'`
3. ❌ Access denied - Popup appears:
   - "Only users who have full access can replay"
   - Bank transfer details
   - "Upgrade Now" button (similar to joinbuildnow)

    - Get today's date and determine if it's a class day
    - If yes, create 3 sessions (morning, afternoon, evening)
    - Assign video based on session_number (sequential)

**Example Calculation:**
- FREELANCING Batch 1 started Monday, Jan 19th
- Today is Wednesday, Jan 21st
- Days since start: 2 days
- Session number: 3 (Class 3)
- Create 3 sessions for Wednesday with session_number = 3

### Notification Scheduling

- **Trigger:** When a new session is created

    - 5 days before: `scheduled_datetime - 5 days`
    - 48 hours before: `scheduled_datetime - 48 hours`
    - 24 hours before: `scheduled_datetime - 24 hours`
    - 3 hours before: `scheduled_datetime - 3 hours`
    - 30 minutes before: `scheduled_datetime - 30 minutes`
  - Create notification records for all enrolled users in that batch
  - Queue notifications for background processing

### Notification Sending

- **Trigger:** Background job runs every minute
- **Action:**
  - Check for notifications where `scheduled_send_time <= now()` AND `status = 'pending'`
  - Send notification (email, Telegram, etc.)
  - Update `sent_at` and `status = 'sent'`
  - If failed, update `status = 'failed'` and log `error_message`
